## Overview

This AI powered platforms revolutionizes credit scoring with a **React Vite** frontend and a **Django** backend. The app follows a structured development workflow with three branches: `dev`, `main`, and `production`.

## Project Structure

- **Frontend**: React with Vite for fast development.
- **Backend**: Django for handling server-side logic.

## Branch Workflow

- **dev branch**: All developers push their changes here.
- **main branch**: Code is reviewed by another team member and merged from `dev` to `main`.
- **production branch**: The team lead reviews code from the `main` branch and pushes it to `production`.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure that the following are installed on your local machine:

- Node.js (v20 or later)
- Python (v3.8 or later)
- Git
- PostgreSQL/MySQL (or your preferred database) Note the backend uses the default db.mysql

### Backend (Django)

   ```bash
   git clone https://{PAT}@github.com/CreditBoost360/CreditBoost.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the server directory:

   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

3. Set up a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install backend dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Navigate to backend repository:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

6. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and update your database and other environment variables:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

7. Run database migrations:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

8. Start the Django server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### Frontend (React Vite)

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontEnd
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the Vite development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Running the Project

- Run the Django backend server and the Vite frontend server simultaneously.
- The backend will run on `http://localhost:8000`, and the frontend will run on `http://localhost:5173`.

## Deployment

### Backend

1. Set up your production environment and make sure all environment variables in `.env` are updated.

2. Migrate the database:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

3. Collect static files:

   ```bash
   python manage.py collectstatic
   ```

4. Use a production server like `gunicorn` or `uwsgi` to serve the Django backend.

### Frontend

1. Build the frontend for production:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Serve the built files using a web server like Nginx or Apache.
