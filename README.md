# CreditBoost: Your Credit Improvement Companion

## What is CreditBoost?

CreditBoost is a simple but powerful app that helps you understand and improve your credit score. Think of it as a personal financial coach that lives in your phone or computer.

## What Does It Actually Do?

1. **Shows Your Credit Score**: Connects to credit bureaus (TransUnion, Experian, Equifax) to show your current score in one place.

2. **Explains Your Score**: Uses AI to explain in plain language why your score is what it is and what affects it.

3. **Helps You Improve**: Gives you step-by-step actions to take that can improve your score over time.

4. **Keeps Your Information Safe**: Uses bank-level security to protect all your financial data.

5. **Creates a "Credit Passport"**: Makes a secure digital version of your credit history that you can share when needed (like when applying for loans).

6. **Teaches About Money**: Includes simple lessons about credit, loans, and saving money.
