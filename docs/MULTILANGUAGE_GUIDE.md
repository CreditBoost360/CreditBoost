4. The interface will immediately update to the selected language

### Setting Default Language

3. You can change your language at any time

### Using Translated Documents

1. When downloading documents (like the Credit Passport)

3. You can switch languages before downloading to get the document in a different language

## Technical Details

### Translation System

The translation system uses:
- A context-based approach with React Context API
- JSON translation files for each supported language
- Dynamic loading of translations
- Fallback to English for missing translations

### Adding New Languages

For developers who want to add support for new languages:
1. Create a new translation file in the translations directory
2. Add the language to the supported languages list
3. Translate all key-value pairs
4. Add the language to the language switcher component

### Translation Keys

The system uses a key-based approach for translations:
- Keys follow a hierarchical structure (e.g., `app.name`, `common.save`)
- Placeholders can be used for dynamic content
- HTML formatting is supported in translations

## Best Practices

### For Users

- Set your preferred language when you first use the application
- Report any untranslated content or incorrect translations
- Use the language that you're most comfortable with for important financial information

### For Developers

- Always use translation keys instead of hardcoded text
- Test the application in all supported languages
- Ensure that all new features include translations for all supported languages
- Consider text expansion/contraction in different languages when designing UI

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Language not changing**
- Clear your browser cache
- Ensure you've selected the correct language
- Try refreshing the page

**Missing translations**
- Some newer content might not be translated yet
