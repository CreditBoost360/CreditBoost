# How We Work Together on CreditBoost

This document explains how our team works together to build and improve CreditBoost.

## For Developers: Making Changes to the Code

### Your Step-by-Step Process

1. **Get the latest version**:
   Make sure you have the most recent code before starting.

   ```bash
   git fetch origin main
   ```

2. **Create your own working copy**:
   Make a new branch where you can safely make changes.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature origin/main
   ```

3. **Make your changes and save them**:
   After making your improvements, save them to your branch.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added this cool new feature"
   ```

4. **Share your changes with the team**:
   Upload your changes so others can see them.

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-new-feature
   ```

5. **Ask for your changes to be added to the main project**:
   Create a pull request to get your code reviewed and merged.
   - Ask specific team members to review your code
   - Make any changes they suggest

6. **Clean up when done**:
   After your changes are accepted, you can remove your working copy.

   ```bash
   git branch -d feature/my-new-feature
   git push origin --delete feature/my-new-feature
   ```

## For Code Reviewers: Checking Others' Work

### Your Step-by-Step Process

1. **Look at the proposed changes**:
   Download the code you need to review.

   ```bash
   git fetch origin feature/my-new-feature
   git checkout feature/my-new-feature
   ```

2. **Check the code carefully**:
   Review the code, run tests, and make sure everything works correctly.

3. **Approve or suggest improvements**:
   - If it looks good, approve the pull request
   - If changes are needed, explain what needs to be fixed

4. **Add approved changes to the main project**:
   Once approved, YOU (the reviewer) should merge the changes into the main project.

## For Team Leaders: Releasing to Production

### Your Step-by-Step Process

1. **Get the latest approved code**:
   Make sure you have the most recent approved changes.

   ```bash
   git fetch origin main
   git checkout main
   ```

2. **Final check before release**:
   Review the latest changes and run tests to make sure everything is ready.

3. **Move approved changes to the production version**:
   Update the production branch with the latest approved changes.

   ```bash
   git checkout production
   git merge origin/main
   ```

4. **Release the new version**:
   Push the updated production version to release it.

   ```bash
   git push origin production
   ```

## Simple Summary

1. **Developers** create new features in separate branches and request reviews
2. **Reviewers** check the code and approve good changes
3. **Team Leaders** move approved changes to the production version

## Basic Rules

- Follow our coding style guidelines
- Make sure your code passes all tests before submitting
- Keep your code up to date with the main branch
- Write clear commit messages explaining what you changed
