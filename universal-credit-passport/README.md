# Credit Passport: Your Digital Credit ID

## What Is a Credit Passport?

A Credit Passport is like a digital ID card for your credit history. Instead of having your credit information scattered across different bureaus and banks, it puts everything in one secure digital document that:

- You control
- Is extremely secure
- Can be shared only when you choose
- Can't be tampered with or altered

## Why This Matters

- **Apply for loans more easily**: Share your verified credit history instantly
- **Prevent fraud**: Your credit history is secured using advanced technology
- **Take your credit anywhere**: Your credit history follows you even when moving to new countries
- **Control your data**: You decide who sees your information and when

## Recent Improvements

We've fixed several issues to make the Credit Passport more reliable:
- Fixed technical errors in the code
- Made file uploads more secure
- Added better error messages when something goes wrong
- Improved security for all your documents
