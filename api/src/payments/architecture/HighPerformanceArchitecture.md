# Sunny Payment Gateway - High Performance Architecture

This document outlines the high-performance architecture for the Sunny Payment Gateway, designed to handle peak transaction volumes similar to major card networks like Visa and Mastercard (65,000-70,000 transactions per second).

## System Architecture Overview

The Sunny payment gateway uses a multi-layered architecture with air-gapped security, distributed processing, and advanced caching to achieve ultra-high performance while maintaining security.

### Core Components

1. **Global Load Balancing Layer**
2. **API Gateway Layer**
3. **Transaction Processing Layer**
4. **Data Storage Layer**
5. **Fraud Detection System**
6. **Security Infrastructure**
7. **Monitoring & Observability**

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Infrastructure

#### PostgreSQL Cluster Configuration
- Primary-replica configuration with automatic failover
- Database sharding by merchant ID and transaction date
- Connection pooling with pgBouncer
- Read-write splitting for optimal performance

#### Redis Cluster for Caching
- Multi-level caching strategy (L1/L2)
- Distributed Redis cluster for session data
- Cache warming for predictable traffic patterns
- Time-to-live (TTL) policies for different data types

### 2. Asynchronous Processing

#### Message Queue Architecture
- RabbitMQ clusters for reliable message delivery
- Kafka for high-throughput event streaming
- Priority queues for transaction processing
- Dead letter queues for failed transactions

#### Event-Driven Processing
- CQRS pattern implementation
- Event sourcing for transaction history
- Idempotent processing to prevent duplicates
- Parallel processing of independent operations

### 3. Horizontal Scaling

#### Container Orchestration
- Kubernetes deployment with auto-scaling
- Stateless service design
- Rolling updates with zero downtime
- Resource limits and requests optimization

#### Load Balancing Strategy
- Layer 7 load balancing with NGINX
- Sticky sessions for stateful operations
- Health checks and circuit breakers
- Connection draining for graceful scaling

### 4. Security Infrastructure

#### Air-Gapped Security Model
- Physical network isolation for payment processing
- Data diodes for one-way information flow
- Hardware security modules (HSMs) for cryptographic operations
- Secure enclaves for sensitive operations

#### Multi-Layered Defense
- Web application firewall (WAF)
- DDoS protection
- Intrusion detection/prevention systems
- Real-time threat intelligence integration

#### Encryption Strategy
- End-to-end encryption for all data
- Automatic key rotation
- Tokenization for sensitive data
- Forward secrecy for all communications

### 5. Performance Optimizations

#### Code Optimizations
- Critical path optimization
- Memory-efficient data structures
- Lock-free algorithms for concurrency
- CPU cache-friendly code patterns

#### Connection Management
- Keep-alive connections
- Connection pooling
- Backpressure handling
- Circuit breakers for failing services

### 6. High Availability

#### Multi-Region Deployment
- Active-active configuration across regions
- Data replication with conflict resolution
- Regional isolation for fault containment
- Global state synchronization

#### Disaster Recovery
- Point-in-time recovery
- Cross-region backup replication
- Recovery time objective (RTO) < 15 minutes
- Recovery point objective (RPO) < 1 minute

### 7. Monitoring & Observability

#### Comprehensive Monitoring
- Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
- Metrics collection with Prometheus
- Log aggregation with ELK stack
- Real-time dashboards with Grafana

#### Alerting System
- Multi-level alerting based on severity
- Anomaly detection for early warning
- Alert correlation to reduce noise
- On-call rotation and escalation paths
